#### Introduction
* Purpose of this Document 
At first, main aim is to why this document is necessary and what’s purpose of document is explained.
* Overview
Here, the description of product is going to explained. It’s simple summary of product.

#### Functional Requirements
In this, possible outcome of software system which includes effects due to operation of program is fully explained. 
All functional requirements which may include calculations, data processing, etc. are placed in a ranked order.

#### Interface Requirements
In this, software interfaces which mean how software program communicates with each other or users either in 
form of any language, code, or message are fully described and explained.

#### Performance Requirements
Here we see, how a software system performs desired functions under specific condition. 
It also explains required time, required memory, maximum error rate, etc.

#### Design Constraints 
In this, constraints which simply means limitation or restriction are specified and explained for design team. 
Examples may include use of a particular algorithm, hardware and software limitations, etc.

#### Non-Functional Attributes :
In this, non-functional attributes are explained that are required by software system for better performance. 
An example may include Security, Portability, Reliability, Reusability, Application compatibility, Data integrity, Scalability capacity, etc.

#### Preliminary Schedule and Budget :
In this, initial version and budget of project plan are explained which include overall time duration required and overall cost required for development of project.
